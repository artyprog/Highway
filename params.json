Just follow a few simple steps to get started!\r\n\r\n#### Step One\r\n\r\nCreate a basic html page and load the highway.js script. You should also have a <span style=\"color: #007700\"><div></span> that has an attribute called <span style=\"color: #0000CC\">highway-view</span>. This will be where each page will be displayed.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html>\r\n\r\n<head>\r\n    <title>Highway JS - Example Page</title>\r\n    <link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>\r\n    <link href=\"style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\r\n</head>\r\n\r\n<body>\r\n    <div class=\"navigation\">\r\n        <img class=\"logo\" src=\"img/logo.png\">\r\n        <ul class=\"nav-list\">\r\n            <li class=\"nav-item\"><a href=\"#home\">Home</a></li>\r\n            <li class=\"nav-item\"><a href=\"#gettingstarted\">Getting Started</a></li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"container\" highway-view></div>\r\n\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"../src/highway.js\"></script>\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"index.js\"></script>\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Step Two\r\n\r\nCreate any HTML files required for each of your pages. Create a javascript file to set up the routes.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n(function() {\r\n\r\n    function HomeViewModel() {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    HomeViewModel.prototype.init = function(element) {\r\n        //this will be called when page is navigated to\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    HomeViewModel.prototype.destroy = function() {\r\n        //this is called when page is left\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    highway.configureRoutes({\r\n        routes: [{\r\n            state: 'home',\r\n            template: 'pages/home/home.html',\r\n            viewmodel: new HomeViewModel()\r\n        }, {\r\n            state: 'gettingstarted',\r\n            template: 'pages/gettingstarted/gettingstarted.html'\r\n        }],\r\n        default: 'home'\r\n    });\r\n})();\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nUse **highway.configureRoutes** to set up the routes. It should receive an object with a routes property which will be an array of route objects, and a property called default which will define the state to go to when one was not specified.  \r\n\r\nA **route** object must have a **state** property. This is a string that is essentially the name of the page. This will be displayed in the url.  \r\n\r\nYou also need a **template** property which is the reference to the HTML file for that view.  \r\n\r\nAn additional **viewmodel** property may be defined that allows a you to set up and tear down a view once it has been displayed.  \r\n\r\nThe view model should have an **init** function which should accept one argument which will contain the root element contained in the template.  \r\n\r\nAnother function called **destroy** can be defined that will be called once a page is left. This allows you to cleanup anything specific to the view.\r\n\r\n#### Step Three\r\n\r\nTo navigate between views simply use an **a** tag and set the **href** to **#state**.\r\n\r\n#### That is all there is to it!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
